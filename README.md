In today's digital landscape, sharing links has become an integral part of communication. However, long URLs can be unwieldy and challenging to share, especially in contexts like social media, emails, or text messages. The URL Shortener Application offers a solution by generating shortened URLs that redirect users to the original content.

## Features

- User-friendly GUI for easy interaction.
- Efficient URL shortening algorithm.
- Copy-to-clipboard functionality for swift sharing.
- Intuitive input validation for error-free usage.

## Getting Started

To get started with the URL Shortener Application, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Ensure you have Python and required libraries (Tkinter, Pyshorteners, Pyperclip) installed.
3. Run the application using `python url_shortener.py`.
4. Input the desired URL and click the "Generate" button to obtain a shortened link.
5. Use the "Copy" button to copy the shortened link to the clipboard.

## Usage

The URL Shortener Application simplifies the process of sharing links, making it more convenient and user-friendly. Users can quickly generate shortened URLs and share them across various platforms with ease.
